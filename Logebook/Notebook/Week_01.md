# **WEEK 1 – Introduction to Programming & Python**

---

## **1. What is Programming?**

Programming is the process of giving **instructions to a computer** so that it can perform a specific task.

A computer cannot think on its own. It only works when we provide **clear and correct instructions**.

### **Simple Example**

Programming is like giving step-by-step instructions to a person to make tea:

1. Boil water
2. Add tea leaves
3. Add sugar and milk
4. Serve tea

Similarly, a computer follows instructions written in a programming language.

## **2. What is Python?**

Python is a **high-level programming language** that is widely used around the world.

### **Key Features of Python**

* Easy to learn and understand
* Simple and readable syntax
* Free and open source
* Very powerful and flexible

### **Uses of Python**

Python is used in many fields such as:

* Web Development
* Data Science
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Cyber Security
* Game Development
* Automation and Scripting

Because of its simplicity, Python is an excellent choice for **beginners**.

## **3. What is Jupyter Notebook?**

Jupyter Notebook is an **interactive tool** used for writing and running Python programs.

### **Jupyter Notebook allows us to:**

* Write Python code
* Execute code step by step
* View output immediately
* Write notes and explanations along with code

This makes Jupyter Notebook very useful for **learning and practice**.

## **4. First Python Program**

Let us write our first Python program.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

### **Explanation**

* `print()` is a built-in Python function
* It is used to display output on the screen
* `"Hello World"` is the message that will be shown

### **Output**

```
Hello World
```
